# ATOM

ATOM - The name come from RealSteel Movie robot ATOM. I took that name because that robot learns moves in that movie from user inputs.

On the road map of creating AI like IronMan J.A.R.V.I.S :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

## Game plan (Initial status)

My current plan is taking images using OpenCV telling **"Hi, I am \<Some name>"**, And creating model based on that. The user object have the lable name from that triggering sentence **"Hi, I am \<Some name>"**.
  
### Current status

Working on OpenCV for taking image and trainning model. Now It's labels and path are hardcoded mode.

In the future going to work on NLP and to get name from triggering sentence **"Hi, I am \<Some name>"**
